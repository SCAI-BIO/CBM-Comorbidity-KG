Nevertheless, using selected confocal sections, we could image an altered Tau localization in SARS-CoV-2-positive neurons. In particular, we identified an enhanced level of Tau into the somas of the SARS-CoV-2-positive neurons."

Compared to un-exposed control organoids, we identified an overall increase in TUNEL-positive cells in SARS-CoV-2-exposed organoids suggesting that virus exposure has caused cell death within 2-dpi."

SET Support = "Furthermore, TUNEL-positive cells in un-exposed control organoids (which could be after programmed cell death) did not contain pT231Tau suggesting that this different Tau phosphorylation pattern is associated with SARS-CoV-2 entry (Fig 3Ciii). Thus, it appears that Tau is aberrantly phosphorylated in response to the viral-induced stress, which may elicit further cell death programs that remains to be elucidated."
